In most cases, the questions below are independent of each other. Many questions accept different ways to address them (which means several "right answers").
1. Suppose your current working directory is /home/wgatua/Linux/Exercises/. What is the command that will enable to move to /home/wgatua/Fun_stuff/?
cd ../../Funstuff

2. How do you count the number of lines contained in a text file?


3. You are in /home/jb/. Suppose this directory is empty. How to you create in only one command the whole path /home/jb/Work/Sequencing/ONT/?
 
 
4. How do you access the help on a given command, for instance the help on grep?


5. Which command would you use in order to create an empty file in the current directory, let's say empty.txt? 


5. Suppose your current working directory contains a file named seqs.txt. How do you rename this file into sequences.fasta? Does this have any effect on the content of the file, and if yes, what does it do?


6. In Unix, how does the extension of a file (the part of the filename after the dot) matter?



7. In Unix, which command will *really* help you to determine the type of a file (i.e. its type of file content, e.g. whether it is a jpeg-compressed image or a pdf file)?

8. How can you create in a single command a file containing the contents "Hello, world!" and named universal_greeting.txt?

9. What about creating the same file but with filename "universal greeting.txt" (the filename contains a space)?


10. How can you use the commandline (on whichever machine you are now, that is connected to the internet) to download directly the file you can see on https://github.com/eanbit-rt/IntroductoryLinux-2019/blob/master/Data/nrf1_seq.fa ? Be careful, you need to get the raw text file itself, not the full HTML page presenting it.


11. How can you count the number of lines in this text file? How do you count the number of sequences?



12. Extract only the identifier lines from this file, and write them into a file called "identifiers.txt".


13. How to write a loop in Bash producing all the integers from 1 to 30, one per line?


14. Create a file called "trial1" and rename it into "trial1.data".


15. Create at once 20 files called "trial1" to "trial20" and *then* rename them all by appending the suffix ".data". Of course, don't issue 20 commands, but just one.


16. In Bash, how do you redirect the output of a command so that it is not displayed on the screen but rather goes into a file?


17. Try this with the command "expr 1 / 0", whose purpose is to calculate the integer result of 1 divided by 0. What happens? Why?
expr: division by zero


18. How can you separately redirect the standard output and the standard error streams into two separate files?

 
19. How can you process the file you got from question 10 to replace all its uppercase "A" letters into lowercase "a" letters, leaving the rest untouched? 


20. In one command, ask for the display of all identifier lines from the same file nrf1_seq.fa without wrapping the lines, i.e. by having all lines displayed on your screen effectively start with the character '>'.



21. Can you write a very short script (possibly one single commandline) to extract from the same file the species names?



22. Once this is done, how to count the species names with their order of multiplicity (i.e. how many sequences belong to Mus musculus, how many to Homo sapiens, etc)?



23. Write a Bash script asking "What's your name?", then waiting for you (the user) to enter you name and press Enter , 
following what the program displays some text according to the following pattern: "Good morning/day/evening, your_name!
 It's now current_time on this lovely day of current_day." and it exits.
